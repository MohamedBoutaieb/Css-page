        <h1>What is lorem Ipsum ?</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. 
            It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, 
            making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor
            at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure
            Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through 
            the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. 
            Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et 
            Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is 
            a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. 
            The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", 
            comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
    
    
            The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced 
            below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et 
            Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English 
            versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.

        <h1>What is The meaning of Life ?</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            The meaning of life, as we perceive it, is derived from philosophical and religious contemplation of, and 
            scientific inquiries about existence, social ties, consciousness, and happiness. Many other issues are 
            also involved, such as symbolic meaning, ontology, value, purpose, ethics, 
            good and evil, free will, the existence of one or multiple gods, 
            conceptions of God, the soul, and the afterlife. Scientific contributions 
            focus primarily on describing related empirical facts about the universe, 
            exploring the context and parameters concerning the "how" of life. 
            Science also studies and can provide recommendations for the pursuit of 
            well-being and a related conception of morality. An alternative, humanistic 
            approach poses the question, "What is the meaning of my life?"

        <h1>What is The purpose of Life ?</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            Your life purpose consists of the central motivating aims of your life—the reasons you get up in the morning.
            Purpose can guide life decisions, influence behavior, shape goals, offer a sense of direction, and create meaning.
             For some people, purpose is connected to vocation—meaningful, 
            satisfying work. For others, their purpose lies in their responsibilities to their family or friends. 
            Others seek meaning through spirituality or religious beliefs. Some people may find their purpose clearly 
            expressed in all these aspects of life.
            Purpose will be unique for everyone; what you identify as your path may be different from others. 
            What’s more, your purpose can actually shift and change throughout life in response to the evolving 
            priorities and fluctuations of your own experiences.
